# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-ML
This project implements a hybrid deep learning model for stock price prediction using historical data. The approach combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture short-term and medium-term temporal trends in financial time series data.
